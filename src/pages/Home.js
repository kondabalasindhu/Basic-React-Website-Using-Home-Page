          There was an old owl who lived in an oak tree. Every day, he observed
          incidents that occurred around him. Yesterday, he watched as a young
          boy helped an old man carry a heavy basket. Today, he saw a young girl
          shouting at her mother. The more he saw, the less he spoke. As the
          days went on, he spoke less but heard more. The old owl heard people
          talking and telling stories. He heard a woman saying an elephant
          jumped over a fence. He heard a man saying that he had never made a
          mistake. The old owl had seen and heard what happened to people. There
          were some who became better, some who became worse. But the old owl in
          the tree had become wiser, each and every day.
